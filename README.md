# tModBuilder
An app that allows you to create terraria mods from a few simple button clicks!

This app, as the description suggests, allows you to create simple terraria mods from just a few button clicks. Pick an item and configure it to your needs and once you're done hit save and build and tModBuilder will make the mod for you and put it in your tmodloader mods folder! All you need to do is boot up tmodloader and play!

This is more of a proof of concept application. It'll probably be updated whenever I feel like it.
